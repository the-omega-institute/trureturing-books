"""``./tbook pin``: pin a trureturing commit and resolve every cited declaration.

``./tbook pin``            follow the branch in site.toml (default ``dev``) to its head
``./tbook pin <sha|ref>``  pin an explicit commit (full or abbreviated SHA), branch or tag
``./tbook pin --refresh``  keep the current commit; add newly cited and prune unused GIDs

Whatever the ref, the commit must be on the site.toml branch: trureturing's CI enforces the
freeze rule (frozen ⇒ kernel-verified, no ``sorry``) only there, while GitHub also serves
pull-request heads and other unmerged commits. A commit that is not on the branch is
refused; one whose ancestry cannot be determined is refused in GitHub Actions and pinned
with a warning elsewhere (``./tbook check`` verifies it again). The branch must be a valid
branch name, not a commit SHA, a full ref or a revision expression such as ``<sha>^0``
(``lean.branch_problem``), and an existing branch: when GitHub says the repository has no
branch of that name (``dev-12-g<sha>``, ``pull/<n>/head``…), the commit is refused; the lock
records the branch, and ``./tbook check`` requires the lock's branch to be site.toml's.

The lock records, per GID, the fully qualified Lean name, its kind, its module's frozen
``statement_id`` and (best effort) the source line and header. When the commit moves,
the report lists modules whose statement digest changed: re-read those theorems'
statements in trureturing and adjust the book text before merging.
